# SimpleToDoApp
A simple to do app with ReactTS

First, I created this app with Vite because the build times are better. to get started - `npm create vite@latest` After I created the app, I
used their efficient CLI to go through, select React, barebones, and Typescript, then cd into the directory and `npm run dev` a very simple process 

For the frontend I used Reactjs with Types, with the backend I just used a Firebase, Firestore database, this wasn't supposed to be an over 
the top project.
